Ideas: 
- IMU for the chest: LP lap BLE (Yang)
- IMU for the wrist and also use ESP32: https://www.adafruit.com/added
- IMu on wrist, and approximate arms with a straght line skeleton
- For swarm spread --> swarm spread we must use yaw which will drift henre use meta quest arm pose to correct the drift (more or less Visual Inertial Odometry)
- For swarm up/down --> we raise/lower arms so it pitch/roll which won't drift so no correction needed for the drift from the meta quest
